DE in Batch Mode	This function iterates all cell types. For each cell type, DE analysis based on Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be performed to compare between two selected cell groups (e.g., WT and KO). The results will be saved in Excel files in a folder provided.
Geometric Sketching [PMID:31176620]	Large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies that profile hundreds of thousands of cells are becoming increasingly common, overwhelming existing analysis pipelines. Here, we describe how to enhance and accelerate single-cell data analysis by summarizing the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a dataset using a small subset of cells, which we refer to as a geometric sketch. Our sketches provide more comprehensive visualization of transcriptional diversity, capture rare cell types with high sensitivity, and reveal biological cell types via clustering.
SnnDpc [DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2018.03.031]	In this paper, we improve the traditional DPC algorithm and propose a shared-nearest-neighbor-based clustering by fast search and find of density peaks, namely, SNN-DPC. SNN-DPC redefines the local density and distance from the nearest larger density point and introduces the shared neighbors and local density information between points; therefore, the newly defined ρ and δ can reflect the attributes of points more objectively and avoid the problem that the traditional DPC algorithm cannot effectively address variable-density clusters.
Differentiation Potency [PMID:33244588]	An important task in the analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data is the estimation of differentiation potency, as this can help identify stem-or-multipotent cells in non-temporal studies or in tissues where differentiation hierarchies are not well established. ... Here, we present a single-cell potency measure, called Correlation of Connectome and Transcriptome (CCAT), which can return accurate single-cell potency estimates of a million cells in minutes, a 100-fold improvement over current state-of-the-art methods.
Predefined Cell Score	This function calculates the cellular score for the expression, also known as gene signature score, for a user-defined set of genes. The score is normalized using either the UCell method (default) or Seurat''s AddModuleScore method. The UCell scores are normalized U statistics, and they are mathematically related to the Area under the ROC curve. These scores only depend on the gene expression ranks of individual cell, and therefore they are robust across datasets regardless of dataset composition. In contrast to Seurat''s AddModuleScore is normalized by binning genes of similar expression at the population level.
HVG Functional Analysis [PMID:31861624]	This function applies to a homogeneous group of cells. Our results support the "variation is function" hypothesis, arguing that scEV is required for cell type-specific, higher-level system function. Thus, quantifying and characterizing scEV are of importance for our understating of normal and pathological cellular processes.
SPIA [PMID:18990722]	We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition.
DP Analysis	Differential Program (DP) Analysis aims to identify gene expression programs, involving multiple functionally related genes, expressed at varying levels between conditions. These differentially expressed programs can provide biological insights into the processes affected by the conditions of interest.
